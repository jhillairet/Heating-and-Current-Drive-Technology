@article{Bibet1995,
abstract = {A new concept-the reflector waveguide array-is proposed to improve and simplify the design of continuous wave lower hybrid (LH) launchers for steady state reactor applications. Mechanical robustness of the antenna and efficient heat removal are provided by a thick wall waveguide structure that can accommodate a large number of cooling ducts. The plasma facing mouthpiece could be made of the same material as the reactor first wall and could be easily replaceable through remote handling. In order to compensate for the increased horizontal distance between adjacent waveguides, the front ends of the thick septa are grooved to form short ( equivalent to lambda /4) passive waveguides that act as reflectors between the radiofrequency powered waveguides (drivers). Then, for an adequate phasing between the active waveguides, the total electric field at the reflector waveguide apertures varies coherently with the one in the drivers to launch a highly directional slow wave. It is shown that the coupling properties of such an array and the directivity of the radiated power spectrum are similar to those of present day launchers. Their dependences upon the depth of the reflector waveguides, and the electron density and its gradient are investigated. The effect of changing the phase between the drivers is also studied. The proposed reflector LH antenna would provide enough flexibility to vary the N // spectrum for plasma control purposes in a steady state fusion reactor},

The plasma current was first raised to 200{\&}ndash;300 kA by the Ohmic heating transformer, and the current in the transformer primary circuit was then held constant to remove the OH drive. After the current fell below 200 kA, up to 300 kW of toroidally-directed RF power at 800 MHz was transmitted into the PLT plasma via a 6-element phased waveguide array.

The high ramp-up efficiencies are predicted theoretically in the regime in which the PLT ramp-up experiments operate, i.e., where the phase velocity of the waves is approximately equal in magnitude to the runaway velocity due to the back voltage. Comparison of the raw data with theory suggest that about {\&}frac12; to {\&}frac34; of the incident RF power is absorbed by resonant high-velocity electrons.},

abstract = {Previously, it has been shown that in a cold, inhomogeneous, magnetized plasma half-space the lower-hybrid resonance is accessible to the transverse-magnetic (TM) plane waves incident on the vacuum-plasma interface at an approximately grazing incidence, provided that at the hybrid layer ? pe /? ce ? 0.4. In this paper, these results are extended to the slow-wave case when n z , the refractive index in the static magnetic field direction, exceeds unity. It is found that the plasma is indeed accessible to the slow waves if Golant's accessibility criterion n z {\textgreater} 1 + (? pe /? ce ) 2 is satisfied. The following recommendations can be made for coupling r.f. energy to the lower-hybrid resonance: (i) if ? pe /? ce ? 0.4, efficient coupling is possible by launching TEM-like waves on the plasma column, (ii) if ? pe /? ce ? 0.4 and if the transverse machine dimensions exceed the r.f. vacuum wavelength, it is possible to couple TM waves using passive slow-wave structures inside the machine walls, (iii) if ? pe /? ce ? 0.4, but for smaller machine dimensions, recourse must be taken to transverse-electric slow-wave coupling with current-carrying coils of appropriate periodicity . If, as was pointed out by Glagolev, propagation from the plasma edge to the hybrid layer is not materially affected by the inclusion of finite-temperature effects, by far the most elegant solution (with potential application to thermonuclear plasmas) for coupling r.f. energy from the second to the twentieth ion-cyclotron harmonic waves is by launching TEM-like waves in the coaxial waveguide formed by the plasma columnand the containing walls.},

abstract = {The launching of RF waves from a two- and four-waveguide array is studied. From Brambilla's grill theory, analytic expressions for the reflection coefficients, the power spectrum and the fields in the slab model of a cold inhomogeneous plasma are derived. As a first approximation to the coupling problem, only the fundamental mode in the waveguides is considered, the fast wave in the plasma is neglected and the density profile near the plasma edge is assumed to be linear. It is shown that for a fourwaveguide array with alternate 0, ? phases, optimum coupling is obtained when the inside waveguides carry about four times the power of the outside ones. This reduces and equalizes the waveguide reflection coefficients and avoids excessive shifts of the penetrated power spectrum to low values of the wavenumber parallel to the magnetic field.},

abstract = {Launching of the fast wave in the lower hybrid frequency range is described. This wave is excited at the plasma edge by RF electric fields perpendicular to those required for the lower hybrid wave. In high-temperature plasmas, where the lower hybrid wave may not penetrate because of Landau damping or other effects near the edge, the fast wave might provide an alternative for heating and/or current generation in the central portion of the plasma. In addition, for high-density plasmas, this has the advantage that lower frequencies than those required for the lower hybrid excitation can be used. Thus waveguides of convenient dimensions for maximum power transmission and ease of fabrication can be employed. Coupling from a waveguide array into an inhomogeneous plasma is analysed. The model is infinite in y, the direction perpendicular to magnetic field and density gradient. Power reflection in the waveguides is found as a function of array design and density gradient at the edge. This reflection is fairly large ({\textgreater} 20{\%}). Propagation into the plasma is then considered, and the field structure and dispersion of the fast waves are found as functions of the distance of penetration. Unlike the lower hybrid waves, fast waves do not form resonance cones and energy is dispersed over a large volume.},

abstract = {A new multijunction grill-type launcher has been tested on the Petula-B tokamak. In this new launcher, the RF power is divided by means of an E-plane junction, and the phase between each resultant wave is obtained by a suitable reduction in the height of the waveguides. Data obtained on Petula-B indicate that both the heating efficiency (4.5 eV � 10 13 cm ?3 �kW ?1 ) and the parametric dependences of the reflection coefficient are very similar to those of a conventional grill. Therefore, such a multijunction grill may greatly simplify the construction of grills considered for use in future large-scale tokamaks.},
