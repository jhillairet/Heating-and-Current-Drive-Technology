@article{Bibet1995,
abstract = {A new concept-the reflector waveguide array-is proposed to improve and simplify the design of continuous wave lower hybrid (LH) launchers for steady state reactor applications. Mechanical robustness of the antenna and efficient heat removal are provided by a thick wall waveguide structure that can accommodate a large number of cooling ducts. The plasma facing mouthpiece could be made of the same material as the reactor first wall and could be easily replaceable through remote handling. In order to compensate for the increased horizontal distance between adjacent waveguides, the front ends of the thick septa are grooved to form short ( equivalent to lambda /4) passive waveguides that act as reflectors between the radiofrequency powered waveguides (drivers). Then, for an adequate phasing between the active waveguides, the total electric field at the reflector waveguide apertures varies coherently with the one in the drivers to launch a highly directional slow wave. It is shown that the coupling properties of such an array and the directivity of the radiated power spectrum are similar to those of present day launchers. Their dependences upon the depth of the reflector waveguides, and the electron density and its gradient are investigated. The effect of changing the phase between the drivers is also studied. The proposed reflector LH antenna would provide enough flexibility to vary the N // spectrum for plasma control purposes in a steady state fusion reactor},

For ions with v⊥ ≥ $\omega$/k⊥, the motion is stochastic for fields satisfying E/B0 {\textgreater} ¼($\Omega$i /$\omega$)1/3($\omega$/k⊥). Provided that the perpendicular phase velocity, $\omega$/k⊥, can be slowed down to a few times the ion thermal speed, this stochastic ion motion may be an important mechanism by which injected rf power near the lower hybrid frequency can directly heat the ions.},

abstract = {The authors have investigated quasi-linear ion Landau damping of lower hybrid waves in an inhomogeneous plasma. To this end, they have simultaneously solved Maxwell equations and the ion kinetic equation, starting from the antenna and proceeding towards the centre of a plane-layered plasma. As a consequence of the development of a suprathermal tail in the ion distribution function, the efficiency of the absorption increases and the absorption region is found to shift to lower densities as the launched power increases. Absorption is always complete at the layer where the wave phase velocity equals about three times the local ion thermal velocity, usually somewhat before the linear turning point is reached.},

abstract = {A study of radiofrequency current ramp-up in the PLT tokamak is reported. The plasma current was first raised to 200{\&}ndash;300 kA by the Ohmic heating transformer, and the current in the transformer primary circuit was then held constant to remove the OH drive. After the current fell below 200 kA, up to 300 kW of toroidally-directed RF power at 800 MHz was transmitted into the PLT plasma via a 6-element phased waveguide array. Current ramp-up rates between 0 and 120 kA/s for a 0.35 s time interval (({\&}frac12;{\&}ndash;1/3) {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}/i{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater} time) where measured at densities between 2 and 4 {\&}times; 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}12{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. It is estimated that about 20{\%} of the RF energy introduced into the vacuum vessel was converted into poloidal magnetic field energy, {\textless}i{\textgreater}LI{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/2, where {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\&}cong; 3 {\&}mu;H is the total inductance of the plasma current loop. This conversion ratio should depend on a variety of factors, including the percentage of RF power absorbed by resonant electrons and the magnitude of the back current induced by the changing poloidal flux {\textless}i{\textgreater}LI{\textless}/i{\textgreater}. The high ramp-up efficiencies are predicted theoretically in the regime in which the PLT ramp-up experiments operate, i.e., where the phase velocity of the waves is approximately equal in magnitude to the runaway velocity due to the back voltage. Comparison of the raw data with theory suggest that about {\&}frac12; to {\&}frac34; of the incident RF power is absorbed by resonant high-velocity electrons.},
