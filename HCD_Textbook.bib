It is made from an array of 6×48 active and 6×9 passive waveguides. The design uses technologies which are relevant for a next step machine such that it can: (i) withstand a plasma radiated flux of 0.15 MW/m2; (ii) radiate power with spectra having peak N∥ values of 2.02±0.35; (iii) withstand a total torque of 8.6 104 N m during disruptions; (iv) allow an antenna 20 cm radial stroke adjustable in real time, (v) withstand a convected power flux of 10 MW/m2 on its guard limiter made of CFC tiles. A prototype of each new component of this antenna has been tested successfully at the nominal power with a pulse length of 1000 s.},

@article{Bibet1995,
abstract = {A new concept-the reflector waveguide array-is proposed to improve and simplify the design of continuous wave lower hybrid (LH) launchers for steady state reactor applications. Mechanical robustness of the antenna and efficient heat removal are provided by a thick wall waveguide structure that can accommodate a large number of cooling ducts. The plasma facing mouthpiece could be made of the same material as the reactor first wall and could be easily replaceable through remote handling. In order to compensate for the increased horizontal distance between adjacent waveguides, the front ends of the thick septa are grooved to form short ( equivalent to lambda /4) passive waveguides that act as reflectors between the radiofrequency powered waveguides (drivers). Then, for an adequate phasing between the active waveguides, the total electric field at the reflector waveguide apertures varies coherently with the one in the drivers to launch a highly directional slow wave. It is shown that the coupling properties of such an array and the directivity of the radiated power spectrum are similar to those of present day launchers. Their dependences upon the depth of the reflector waveguides, and the electron density and its gradient are investigated. The effect of changing the phase between the drivers is also studied. The proposed reflector LH antenna would provide enough flexibility to vary the N // spectrum for plasma control purposes in a steady state fusion reactor},

To this end, they have simultaneously solved Maxwell equations and the ion kinetic equation, starting from the antenna and proceeding towards the centre of a plane-layered plasma. As a consequence of the development of a suprathermal tail in the ion distribution function, the efficiency of the absorption increases and the absorption region is found to shift to lower densities as the launched power increases. Absorption is always complete at the layer where the wave phase velocity equals about three times the local ion thermal velocity, usually somewhat before the linear turning point is reached.},

abstract = {Previously, it has been shown that in a cold, inhomogeneous, magnetized plasma half-space the lower-hybrid resonance is accessible to the transverse-magnetic (TM) plane waves incident on the vacuum-plasma interface at an approximately grazing incidence, provided that at the hybrid layer ? pe /? ce ? 0.4. In this paper, these results are extended to the slow-wave case when n z , the refractive index in the static magnetic field direction, exceeds unity. It is found that the plasma is indeed accessible to the slow waves if Golant's accessibility criterion n z {\textgreater} 1 + (? pe /? ce ) 2 is satisfied. The following recommendations can be made for coupling r.f. energy to the lower-hybrid resonance: (i) if ? pe /? ce ? 0.4, efficient coupling is possible by launching TEM-like waves on the plasma column, (ii) if ? pe /? ce ? 0.4 and if the transverse machine dimensions exceed the r.f. vacuum wavelength, it is possible to couple TM waves using passive slow-wave structures inside the machine walls, (iii) if ? pe /? ce ? 0.4, but for smaller machine dimensions, recourse must be taken to transverse-electric slow-wave coupling with current-carrying coils of appropriate periodicity . If, as was pointed out by Glagolev, propagation from the plasma edge to the hybrid layer is not materially affected by the inclusion of finite-temperature effects, by far the most elegant solution (with potential application to thermonuclear plasmas) for coupling r.f. energy from the second to the twentieth ion-cyclotron harmonic waves is by launching TEM-like waves in the coaxial waveguide formed by the plasma columnand the containing walls.},

abstract = {A prototype passive active multijunction (PAM) launcher for lower hybrid (LH) waves conceptually similar to that foreseen for ITER has been successfully tested on FTU at frequency f = 8 GHz. The power routinely and safely managed for the maximum time allowed by the LH power plant (0.9 s) without any fault in the transmission lines is 250 kW, corresponding to 75 MW m ?2 across the antenna active area and very close to the design value of 270 kW or 80 MW m ?2 . The achieved value is at least 1.4 times larger than the ITER request, which would be only 52 MW m ?2 , if the 33 MW m ?2 required to the ITER grill in order to couple 20 MW to the plasma, are scaled up linearly with f , from f ITER = 5 GHz. This linear scaling of the power handling capability of the LH antennae is indeed conservative with respect to the available data. The test results validate also the other two main expectations relevant to ITER, foreseen by the codes, namely to operate with the grill entirely in the vessel shadow and to still preserve good current drive (CD) efficiency. Even with the grill mouth retracted 2 mm inside the port shadow and with density in front of the launcher very close or even lower than the cut-off value, the PAM reflection coefficient is always ? 2.5{\%}, if the antenna has been properly conditioned. The CD efficiency is comparable to that of a conventional grill, once the lower directivity is taken into account. Flexibility in determining the N || spectrum is also maintained, according to hard x-rays and electron cyclotron emission spectra. Conditioning the PAM in order to operate at the ITER equivalent power level required only one day of radio-frequency operation, without a previous baking of the waveguides.},

abstract = {The TORE SUPRA lower hybrid current drive experiments (8 MW/3.7 GHz) use large phased waveguide arrays, four rows of 32 active waveguides and two passive waveguides for each of the two grills, to couple the waves to the plasma. These launchers are based on the 'multijunction' principle which allows them to be quite compact and is therefore attractive for the design of efficient multi-megawatt antennas in NET/ITER. Extensive coupling measurements have been performed in order to study the radiofrequency (RF) characteristics of the plasma loaded antennas. Measurements of the plasma scattering coefficients of the antennas show good agreement with those obtained from the linear coupling theory (SWAN code). Global reflection coefficients of a few per cent have been measured in a large range of edge plasma densities (0.3 x 10(18)  m-3  less-than-or-equal-to n(eg) less-than-or-equal-to 1.4 x 10(18) m-3) or antenna positions (0.02-0.05 m from the plasma edge) and up to a maximum injected RF power density of 45 MW/m2. When the plasma is pushed against the inner wall of the chamber, the reflection coefficient is found to remain low up to distances of the order of 0. 10 m. The coupling measurements allow us to deduce the 'experimental' power spectra radiated by the antennas when all their modules are fed simultaneously with variable phases. Thus, the multijunction launcher is assessed as a viable antenna for high power transmission with good coupling characteristics and spectrum control.},

abstract = {The launching of RF waves from a two- and four-waveguide array is studied. From Brambilla's grill theory, analytic expressions for the reflection coefficients, the power spectrum and the fields in the slab model of a cold inhomogeneous plasma are derived. As a first approximation to the coupling problem, only the fundamental mode in the waveguides is considered, the fast wave in the plasma is neglected and the density profile near the plasma edge is assumed to be linear. It is shown that for a fourwaveguide array with alternate 0, ? phases, optimum coupling is obtained when the inside waveguides carry about four times the power of the outside ones. This reduces and equalizes the waveguide reflection coefficients and avoids excessive shifts of the penetrated power spectrum to low values of the wavenumber parallel to the magnetic field.},

Its structure is designed for maximum flexibility regarding the choice of coordinate system and dielectric model. The versatility of this code makes it particularly suitable for integrated modeling systems. Using a coordinate system that reflects the nested structure of magnetic flux surfaces in tokamaks, fast and accurate calculations inside the plasma separatrix can be performed using analytical derivatives of a spline-Fourier interpolation of the axisymmetric toroidal MHD equilibrium. Applications to reverse field pinch magnetic configuration are also included. The effects of 3D perturbations of the axisymmetric toroidal MHD equilibrium, due to the discreteness of the magnetic coil system or plasma fluctuations in an original quasi-optical approach, are also studied. Using a Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method for solving the set of ordinary differential equations, the ray-tracing code is extensively benchmarked against analytical models and other codes for lower hybrid and electron cyclotron waves.

A combination of ray-tracing and Fokker?Planck calculations are presented for various plasma scenarios, wave frequency and polarization. The dependence of the driven current and the location of power deposition upon the coupled wave spectrum is systematically determined, in order to set objectives for the antenna design. The respective effects of finite-power levels, magnetic trapping, and detailed antenna spectra are accounted for and quantitatively estimated. The sensitivity of LHCD to density and temperature profiles is calculated. From the simulation results, an optimum value for the parallel index of refraction is proposed as a compromise between efficiency and robustness with respect to those profile variations. The corresponding current drive efficiency is found to be similar for the two frequencies generally considered for ITER, f = 3.7 GHz and f = 5.0 GHz.},

abstract = {A new concept of multijunction-type antenna has been developed, the Passive-Active Multijunction, which improves the cooling of the waveguides and the damping of the neutron energy (for ITER) compared to Full Active Multijunction. Due to the complexity of the structures, prototypes of the mode converters and of the Passive-Active-Multijunction launcher were fabricated and tested, in order to validate the different manufacturing processes and the manufacturer's capability to face this challenging project. This paper describes the manufacturing process, the tests of the various prototypes and the construction of the final Passive-Active-Multijunction launcher, which entered into operation in October 2009. It has been commissioned and is fully operational on the Tore-Supra tokamak, since design objectives were reached in March 2010: 2.75 MW - 78 s, power density of 25 MW/m2 in active waveguides, steady-state apparent surface temperatures {\textless}350 °C; 10 cm long distance coupling. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The TORE SUPRA lower hybrid current drive experiments (8 MW/3.7 GHz) use large phased waveguide arrays, four rows of 32 active waveguides and two passive waveguides for each of the two grills, to couple the waves to the plasma. These launchers are based on the 'multijunction' principle which allows them to be quite compact and is therefore attractive for the design of efficient multi-megawatt antennas in NET/ITER. Extensive coupling measurements have been performed in order to study the radiofrequency (RF) characteristics of the plasma loaded antennas. Measurements of the plasma scattering coefficients of the antennas show good agreement with those obtained from the linear coupling theory (SWAN code). Global reflection coefficients of a few per cent have been measured in a large range of edge plasma densities (0.3 x 10(18)  m-3  less-than-or-equal-to n(eg) less-than-or-equal-to 1.4 x 10(18) m-3) or antenna positions (0.02-0.05 m from the plasma edge) and up to a maximum injected RF power density of 45 MW/m2. When the plasma is pushed against the inner wall of the chamber, the reflection coefficient is found to remain low up to distances of the order of 0. 10 m. The coupling measurements allow us to deduce the 'experimental' power spectra radiated by the antennas when all their modules are fed simultaneously with variable phases. Thus, the multijunction launcher is assessed as a viable antenna for high power transmission with good coupling characteristics and spectrum control.},

abstract = {A new ITER-relevant lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) launcher, based on the passive-active-multijunction (PAM) concept, was brought into operation on the Tore Supra tokamak in autumn 2009. The PAM launcher concept was designed in view of ITER to allow efficient cooling of the waveguides, as required for long pulse operation. In addition, it offers low power reflection close to the cut-off density, which is very attractive for ITER, where the large distance between the plasma and the wall may bring the density in front of the launcher to low values. The first experimental campaign on Tore Supra has shown extremely encouraging results in terms of reflected power level and power handling. Power reflection coefficient {\textless}2{\%} is obtained at low density in front of the launcher, i.e. close to the cut-off density, and very good agreement between the experimental results and the coupling code predictions is obtained. Long pulse operation at ITER-relevant power density has been demonstrated. The maximum power and energy reached so far is 2.7MW during 78 s, corresponding to a power density of 25MWm-2, i.e. its design value at f = 3.7 GHz. In addition, 2.7MWhas been coupled at a plasma-launcher distance of 10 cm, with a power reflection coefficient {\textless}2{\%}. Finally, full non-inductive discharges have been sustained for 50 s with the PAM. {\textcopyright} 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The text collects in a structured and self-contained way the basic knowledge on the broad and varied behavior of plasma waves, adopting the microscopic kinetic description of the plasma as unifying principle. The internal coherence of the theory is explicitly stressed, and interesting physical phenomena peculiar to plasmas are discussed in detail, including collisionless damping of waves, the development of stochasticity in the interactions of charged particles with electromagnetic waves, and nonlinear interactions between waves. The most common and useful approximations used in solving practical problems are derived as special cases from the more general kinetic approach, thereby clarifying their meaning and domain of applicability. This exposition should be useful to plasma physicists both as an introduction and a reference to this field of research.},

abstract = {Launching of the fast wave in the lower hybrid frequency range is described. This wave is excited at the plasma edge by RF electric fields perpendicular to those required for the lower hybrid wave. In high-temperature plasmas, where the lower hybrid wave may not penetrate because of Landau damping or other effects near the edge, the fast wave might provide an alternative for heating and/or current generation in the central portion of the plasma. In addition, for high-density plasmas, this has the advantage that lower frequencies than those required for the lower hybrid excitation can be used. Thus waveguides of convenient dimensions for maximum power transmission and ease of fabrication can be employed. Coupling from a waveguide array into an inhomogeneous plasma is analysed. The model is infinite in y, the direction perpendicular to magnetic field and density gradient. Power reflection in the waveguides is found as a function of array design and density gradient at the edge. This reflection is fairly large ({\textgreater} 20{\%}). Propagation into the plasma is then considered, and the field structure and dispersion of the fast waves are found as functions of the distance of penetration. Unlike the lower hybrid waves, fast waves do not form resonance cones and energy is dispersed over a large volume.},

@article{Theilhaber1980,
abstract = {Launching of the fast wave in the lower hybrid frequency range is described. This wave is excited at the plasma edge by RF electric fields perpendicular to those required for the lower hybrid wave. In high-temperature plasmas, where the lower hybrid wave may not penetrate because of Landau damping or other effects near the edge, the fast wave might provide an alternative for heating and/or current generation in the central portion of the plasma. In addition, for high-density plasmas, this has the advantage that lower frequencies than those required for the lower hybrid excitation can be used. Thus waveguides of convenient dimensions for maximum power transmission and ease of fabrication can be employed. Coupling from a waveguide array into an inhomogeneous plasma is analysed. The model is infinite in y, the direction perpendicular to magnetic field and density gradient. Power reflection in the waveguides is found as a function of array design and density gradient at the edge. This reflection is fairly large ({\textgreater} 20{\%}). Propagation into the plasma is then considered, and the field structure and dispersion of the fast waves are found as functions of the distance of penetration. Unlike the lower hybrid waves, fast waves do not form resonance cones and energy is dispersed over a large volume.},

abstract = {The material presented in the book is built on a substrate of knowledge already provided by the basic sciences of mathematics and physics. Students are supposed to be acquainted with certain topics, such as linear algebra, differential equations, integral calculus, vector analysis and complex functions. If students still have difficulties with these topics, they may have to recap them in order to refresh their skills. This book is not a treatise on electricity and magnetism – its scope is far less ambitious. Its content can be delivered in a single-semester course, and is aimed to provide a scientifically founded and unified basis of fundamental knowledge on electromagnetic field phenomena that will help students follow up more advanced subjects covered in their courses. Topics are introduced in a systematic and friendly manner, proceeding from the simpler to more difficult ones, using a slow build-up process. In addition, a series of application examples and homework problems have been prepared to help students through the learning process. The fact that the book is partitioned into chapters does not imply that some of them can be skipped. Because the subject matter is deeply interrelated, students must try to adhere to the normal chapter sequence, otherwise they may be wasting their time or fail to get an integrated comprehensive view of the electromagnetic phenomena.},

abstract = {Progress in experiment and simulation capability in the lower hybrid range of frequencies at ITER relevant parameters is reviewed. Use of LH power in reactor devices is motivated in terms of its potential for efficient off-axis current profile control. Recent improvements in simulation capability including the development of full-wave field solvers, inclusion of the scrape off layer (SOL) in wave propagation codes, the use of coupled ray tracing/full-wave/3D (r v?, v//) Fokker Planck models, and the inclusion of wave scattering as well as nonlinear broadening effects in ray tracing / Fokker Planck codes are discussed. Experimental and modeling results are reviewed which are aimed at understanding the spectral gap problem in LH current drive (LHCD) and the density limit that has been observed and mitigated in LHCD experiments. Physics mechanisms that could be operative in these experiments are discussed, including toroidally induced variations in the parallel wavenumber, nonlinear broadening of the pump wave, scattering of LH waves from density fluctuations in the SOL, and spectral broadening at the plasma edge via full-wave effects.},

abstract = {A study of radiofrequency current ramp-up in the PLT tokamak is reported. The plasma current was first raised to 200–300 kA by the Ohmic heating transformer, and the current in the transformer primary circuit was then held constant to remove the OH drive. After the current fell below 200 kA, up to 300 kW of toroidally-directed RF power at 800 MHz was transmitted into the PLT plasma via a 6-element phased waveguide array. Current ramp-up rates between 0 and 120 kA/s for a 0.35 s time interval ((½–1/3) L/R time) where measured at densities between 2 and 4 × 1012 cm−3. It is estimated that about 20{\%} of the RF energy introduced into the vacuum vessel was converted into poloidal magnetic field energy, LI2/2, where L ≅ 3 $\mu$H is the total inductance of the plasma current loop. This conversion ratio should depend on a variety of factors, including the percentage of RF power absorbed by resonant electrons and the magnitude of the back current induced by the changing poloidal flux LI. The high ramp-up efficiencies are predicted theoretically in the regime in which the PLT ramp-up experiments operate, i.e., where the phase velocity of the waves is approximately equal in magnitude to the runaway velocity due to the back voltage. Comparison of the raw data with theory suggest that about ½ to ¾ of the incident RF power is absorbed by resonant high-velocity electrons.},

In this new launcher, the RF power is divided by means of an E-plane junction, and the phase between each resultant wave is obtained by a suitable reduction in the height of the waveguides. Data obtained on Petula-B indicate that both the heating efficiency (4.5 eV � 10 13 cm ?3 �kW ?1 ) and the parametric dependences of the reflection coefficient are very similar to those of a conventional grill. Therefore, such a multijunction grill may greatly simplify the construction of grills considered for use in future large-scale tokamaks.},
